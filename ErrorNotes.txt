Some things to keep in mind

Because I'm an idiot and there is a top level node_modules folder and node_modules folders in each react app folder, you can sometimes get
duplicate react instances. As a result I deleted react in the top node_modules folder to fix this issue so that hooks can be used.
However, I didn't delete the entire node_modules folder just cuz i'm not sure what the overlap or relationship between that folder
and the fitness app node_modules folder is...
